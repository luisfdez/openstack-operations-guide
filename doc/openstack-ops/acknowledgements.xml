    <para>The OpenStack Foundation supported the creation of this book with
        plane tickets to Austin, lodging (including one adventurous evening
        without power after a windstorm), and delicious food. For about USD
        $10,000, we could collaborate intensively for a week in the same room at
        the Rackspace Austin office. The authors are all members of the
        OpenStack Foundation, which you can join. Go to the <link

    <para>Inside the book sprint room with us each day was our book
        sprint facilitator Adam Hyde. Without his tireless support and
        encouragement, we would have thought a book of this scope was
        impossible in five days. Adam has proven the book sprint
        method effectively again and again. He creates both tools and
        faith in collaborative authoring at <link

    <para>We couldn't have pulled it off without so much supportive help and
        encouragement.</para>
