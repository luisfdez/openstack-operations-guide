        <title>NeCTAR</title>
        <para>Who uses it: Researchers from the Australian publicly
            funded research sector. Use is across a wide variety of
            disciplines, with the purpose of instances being from
            running simple web servers to using hundreds of cores for
            high throughput computing.</para>

            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>Using OpenStack Compute Cells, the NeCTAR Cloud
                spans eight sites with approximately 4,000 cores per
                site.</para>
            <para>Each site runs a different configuration, as
                resource <glossterm>cell</glossterm>s in an OpenStack
                Compute cells setup. Some sites span multiple data
                centers, some use off compute node storage with a
                shared file system and some use on compute node
                storage with a non-shared file system. Each site
                deploys the Image Service with an Object Storage
                back-end. A central Identity Service, Dashboard and
                Compute API Service is used. Login to the Dashboard
                triggers a SAML login with Shibboleth, that creates an
                    <glossterm>account</glossterm> in the Identity
                Service with an SQL back-end.</para>
            <para>Compute nodes have 24 to 48 cores, with at least 4
                GB of RAM per core and approximately 40 GB of
                ephemeral storage per core.</para>
            <para>All sites are based on Ubuntu 12.04 with KVM as the
                hypervisor. The OpenStack version in use is typically
                the current stable version, with 5 to 10% back ported
                code from trunk and modifications.</para>

            and Artificial Intelligence Lab.</para>

            <!--FIXME - update numbers and release information for 2013 -->
            <para>The CSAIL cloud is currently 64 physical nodes with
                a total of 768 physical cores and 3,456 GB of RAM.
                Persistent data storage is largely outside of the
                cloud on NFS with cloud resources focused on compute
                resources. There are 65 users in 23 projects with
                typical capacity utilization nearing 90% we are
                looking to expand.</para>
            <para>The software stack is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with
                OpenStack Folsom from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. KVM is
                the hypervisor, deployed using
                <link xlink:href="http://fai-project.org">FAI</link>
                (http://fai-project.org/)
                and Puppet for configuration
                management. The FAI and Puppet combination is used lab
                wide, not only for OpenStack. There is a single cloud
                controller node, with the remainder of the server
                hardware dedicated to compute nodes. Due to the
                compute intensive nature of the use case, the ratio of
                physical CPU and RAM to virtual is 1:1 in nova.conf.
                Although hyper-threading is enabled so, given the way
                Linux counts CPUs, this is actually 2:1 in
                practice.</para>
            <para>On the network side, physical systems have two
                network interfaces and a separate management card for
                IPMI management. The OpenStack network service uses
                multi-host networking and the FlatDHCP.</para>

        <title>DAIR</title>
        <para>Who uses it: DAIR is an integrated virtual environment
            that leverages the CANARIE network to develop and test new
            information communication technology (ICT) and other
            digital technologies. It combines such digital
            infrastructure as advanced networking, and cloud computing
            and storage to create an environment for develop and test
            of innovative ICT applications, protocols and services,
            perform at-scale experimentation for deployment, and
            facilitate a faster time to market.</para>
        <section xml:id="dair_deploy">
            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>DAIR is hosted at two different data centres across
                Canada: one in Alberta and the other in Quebec. It
                consists of a cloud controller at each location,
                however, one is designated as the "master" controller
                that is in charge of central authentication and
                quotas. This is done through custom scripts and light
                modifications to OpenStack. DAIR is currently running
                Folsom.</para>
            <para>For Object Storage, each region has a Swift
                environment.</para>
            <para>A NetApp appliance is used in each region for both
                block storage and instance storage. There are future
                plans to move the instances off of the NetApp
                appliance and onto a distributed file system such as
                    <glossterm>Ceph</glossterm> or GlusterFS.</para>
            <para>VlanManager is used extensively for network
                management. All servers have two bonded 10gb NICs that
                are connected to two redundant switches. DAIR is set
                up to use single-node networking where the cloud
                controller is the gateway for all instances on all
                compute nodes. Internal OpenStack traffic (for
                example, storage traffic) does not go through the
                cloud controller.</para>

            research.</para>
        <section xml:id="cern_deploy">
            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>The environment is largely based on Scientific Linux
                6, which is Red Hat compatible. We use KVM as our
                primary hypervisor although tests are ongoing with
                Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008.</para>
            <para>We use the Puppet Labs OpenStack modules to
                configure Compute, Image Service, Identity Service and
                Dashboard. Puppet is used widely for instance
                configuration and Foreman as a GUI for reporting and
                instance provisioning.</para>
            <para>Users and Groups are managed through Active
                Directory and imported into the Identity Service using
                LDAP. CLIs are available for Nova and Euca2ools to do
                this.</para>
            <para>There are 3 clouds currently running at CERN, totaling
            around 3400 Nova Compute nodes, with approximately 60,000 cores.
            The CERN IT cloud aims to expand to 300,000 cores by 2015.
